## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.2] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **`kanibako shell <box> -e KEY=VAL -- cmd` now applies `-e` vars when the box
  is already running.** When a persistent box was up, the shell-into-running
  shortcut exec'd the command without the per-run `-e`/`--env` vars, so the same
  command behaved differently depending on whether the box happened to be
  running (the vars were applied on a fresh launch but silently dropped on
  exec). The per-run env is now passed to the exec'd process in both cases.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- **User-override templates are now discoverable.** `rig list` and
  `rig create --template` validation also scan the user-override containers
  directory (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/kanibako/containers/`) for
  `Containerfile.template-<name>` files, mirroring the override-first
  precedence already used when building. User-provided templates appear in
  `rig list` marked `(user)` and a user template overrides a bundled one of the
  same name. (#74b)

### Fixed

- **`kanibako rm --purge` no longer crashes on a started box.** A box whose
  shell directory contains files a rootless container created (owned by mapped
  subuids the host user cannot unlink) previously aborted `rm --purge` with a
  Python traceback. Such trees are now removed via the user namespace
  (`podman unshare`), with a clean warning if removal still cannot complete.

### Changed

- Maintenance: the CI container-image workflow now rebuilds only the bundled
  templates whose `Containerfile.template-*` changed (full rebuild only on a
  shared/base change), cutting build time (#74a). The e2e test harness gained a
  pinned-store pre-warm with diagnostics and a corrected timeout, plus new
  coverage for env forwarding, flag-after-positional parsing, shell-exec into a
  running box, `ps`/`ps -q`, and `rm --purge` (#74c, #79). No user-facing change.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Bundled toolchain templates and `rig create --template <name>`.** Kanibako
  ships a curated set of toolchain templates that build on demand onto any base
  rig via `ARG BASE_IMAGE`: `jvm` (Java/Kotlin/Maven), `systems`
  (C/C++/Rust/cross-compilation), `js` (yarn/pnpm/bun/TypeScript), `dotnet`
  (.NET 8 LTS SDK), and `android` (Android SDK command-line tools + NDK).
  - `kanibako rig create <name> --template <template> [--base <variant>]` builds
    the bundled template non-interactively into a local `kanibako-template-<name>`
    image. Without `--template`, `rig create` keeps its interactive
    install-and-commit flow.
  - Templates are auto-discovered by the `Containerfile.template-<name>` filename
    convention (descriptions from a `# kanibako-template:` header); dropping such
    a file makes it appear in `rig list`, become buildable, and get published by
    CI with no code or workflow edits.
  - Prebuilt template images are published to GHCR as
    `kanibako-template-<name>-<variant>` for the `min`/`oci`/`lxc`/`vm` variants,
    via a dynamic CI build matrix.

### Changed

- Local and workset project modes were unified onto a single code path, carrying
  the distinction as data (a `ProjectGroup` descriptor) rather than control flow.
  Behavior-preserving; no user-visible change.
